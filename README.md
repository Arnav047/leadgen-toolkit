# leadgen-toolkit

This repository contains two lightweight tools designed to support lead generation and outreach research, inspired by the core ideas behind GetCohesiveAIâ€™s scraping platform. The tools are built for speed and simplicity, allowing users to access publicly available intelligence on company hiring trends and professional LinkedIn profiles using streamlined interfaces and minimal dependencies.

The first tool, titled LinkedIn Account Finder, enables users to input a company name and receive a list of likely LinkedIn profiles of employees working at that company. It uses a pre-existing dataset named companies.csv which contains sample company entries. The tool simulates profile extraction using automated Google search queries and returns relevant results without relying on premium APIs. This functionality can assist users in identifying professionals for networking, sales outreach, or candidate research.

The second tool, called Job Role Analyzer, takes a company name as input and scrapes real-time job openings from publicly accessible platforms like Lever and Greenhouse. It focuses on identifying opportunities in AI, data, and sales-related departments and presents job titles, departments, and locations in a clean tabular format. This offers users valuable hiring insights to assess whether a company is in a growth phase or open to product/service pitches in specific areas.

Each tool is implemented as a separate Streamlit application and can be run independently from the terminal. The design emphasizes practical, time-sensitive development with clear outputs relevant for recruiters, students, or sales professionals.
